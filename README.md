Hi, welcome to the asteroids game repo, it's a little game made with python for the boot.dev course, it takes on a form of an old game
similar to spaceships, boot up the game, destroy the asteroids into smaller ones and don't die! 


To run:

    python3 main.py
    
Keybinds:

W: Move forward

S: Move backwards

A: Rotate left

D: Rotate Right

SPACE: Shoot
